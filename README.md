> “While others guard the gates, I slip through the signals.”  

I operate at the edges of signal and silence — exploring Wi-Fi pentesting, Flipper Zero modding, and AI-driven tooling. I don’t just learn — I endure, iterate, and evolve. This profile documents the path I’m carving through the noise.

## 🧭 Philosophy

> *"Pursue your fears in silence. Stretch your comfort zone with stoic resilience and unshakable discipline."*

This is the path of the shinobi. I don’t seek attention — I seek understanding. I push into the unknown, one test, one tool, one quiet breakthrough at a time.
